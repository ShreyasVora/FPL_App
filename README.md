# FPL_App
Contains all code for my FPL App. To run the app, save all files into a folder and run the main.py program. Runs much better on a mobile device (using a Python interpreter such as Pydroid or QPython). The modules that are required to be installed before running the program are: numpy, math, csv, kivy, asyncio, aiohttp, understat, tabulate, colorama, pandas, statsmodels, scipy, tqdm, pickle, urllib, json.

Please report bugs to shreyas_vora@hotmail.co.uk.
